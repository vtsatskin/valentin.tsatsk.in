				<b style="font-size: 1.3em;">The Situation</b><br />
				If your business is involved in developing new procedures, products, or materials, it may be eligible for a yearly government cash rebate.<br /><br />
				<b>What work qualifies</b><br />    
				Types of operations may vary from one environment to another. It is highly recommended to consult a SR &amp; ED specialist for determination of potential eligibility, as some not so obvious production or engineering work may qualify. Science Experts offers an eligibility consultation in a friendly manner at no cost.<br /><br />
				<b>Amounts retrieved</b><br />
				Cash rebates vary depending on the type expenditures incurred. In general, most of the rebates vary between 1,500 and 500,000 dollars.<br /><br />
				<b>SR &amp; ED risks</b><br />
				During preliminary internal audit, Science Experts would eliminate any risk associated with the submission of a SR &amp; ED Claim. In some cases it takes no longer than two to three hours of your time to provide us with all the required input.<br /><br />
				<b>Application Costs</b><br />
				No cost is charged until your check is in the mail.

      <h2>Hackathons</h2>
      <p>
        I both participate in and organize hackathons.<label for="sn-hackathon" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-hackathon" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="sidenote">A definition of what a Hackathon is.</span> Most of the time I will have something worthwhile to show for. A curated list of such times is provided below.
      </p>

      <h3>Hack the North</h3>
      <p>
        I helped co-found Canada's largest hackathon.
        <label for="mn-htnlogo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="mn-htnlogo" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="marginnote">
          <img src="img/htn-logo.svg" style="max-width: 200px">
        </span>
        I was involved in the first two itterations which occured in 2014 and 2015. It attracted 1000+ hackers from 100 schools in 10 countries.
      </p>

      <p>
        My major involvement was <a href="http://hackthenorth.com">leading the website team</a>. I also happened to MC both times and I'm not really sure why anyone thought I would do a good job at that.
      </p>

      <h3>SurroundSound</h3>
      <p>
        My teammates and I tried to create a solution for delivering music most people at a social event would like. We attempt to provide a curated YouTube playlist for a DJ based on attendee's music preferences. I think it worked once.

        The code is <a href="https://github.com/mHacks-UWProject/SurroundSound">open-sourced on GitHub</a>. This occured at the inaugral <a href="http://mhacks.org">MHacks</a> in 2012.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've also helped organize a few hackathons.

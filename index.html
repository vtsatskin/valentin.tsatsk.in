      <h2>UX Designs</h2>
      <h3>Firefox Network Error Design Specifications</h3>
      <p>
        A proposed redesign for Firefox's Network Error pages. Most of the changes did not get implemeneted, however <a href="https://vtsatskin.github.com/fx-network-errors">I've created a writeup outlining the design</a>. <label for="sn-network-errors" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-network-errors" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="sidenote">
          Unfortunately there's a bug in the build script for creating these docs which causes the correct fonts not to be included.
        </span>
      </p>

      <h3>Handling Captive Portals in Firefox</h3>
      <p>
        This was an attempt at fixing the frustrating experience of using a public wifi and having to painstakenly log into it. You can check out <a href="https://github.com/vtsatskin/FX-Captive-Portals-Design/blob/master/design/spec.md">the design docs on GitHub</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Firefox for Android New Tab Experimentation</h3>
      <p>We invisioned that switching tabs should be easy enough you can do it one-handed. You can find <a href="https://github.com/vtsatskin/Fennec-Tab-Experimentation">the designs on GitHub.</a></p>
      <p>
        You can also <a href="https://vtsatskin.github.com/Fennec-Tab-Experimentation/prototype">try an interactive web demo</a> which conveys the interaction design details. We also built <a href="https://github.com/notonepine/TabSwitcher">an Android app demo</a> if you know how to sideload apps.

      <h2>Hackathons</h2>
      <p>
        I both participate in and organize hackathons.<label for="sn-hackathon" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-hackathon" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="sidenote">A Hackathon is “an event, typically lasting several days, in which a large number of people meet to engage in collaborative computer programming”—<em>New Oxford American Dictionary</em></span> Most of the time I will have something worthwhile to show for. A curated list of such times is provided below.
      </p>

      <h3>Hack the North</h3>
      <p>
        I helped co-found Canada's largest hackathon.
        <label for="mn-htnlogo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="mn-htnlogo" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="marginnote">
          <img src="img/htn-logo.svg" style="max-width: 200px" alt="Hack the North Logo">
        </span>
        I was involved in the first two itterations which occured in 2014 and 2015. It attracted 1000+ hackers from 100 schools in 10 countries.
      </p>

      <p>
        My major involvement was <a href="http://hackthenorth.com">leading the website team</a>. I also happened to MC both times and I'm not really sure why anyone thought I would do a good job at that.
      </p>

      <h3>NavajoChat</h3>
      <p>
        I created a proof of concept Google Chrome extension to encrypt transmission of Facebook messages. The messages are not stored in plain text on the server and thus can only be read by the intended audiences. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDh5X_RjTPY">watch a demo video on YouTube</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the curious, it uses OpenGPG for encryption. This isn't a serious attempt at securing your messages and there's probably plenty of holes. The code is <a href="https://github.com/vtsatskin/NavajoChat">open sourced on GitHub</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Lunch Roulette</h3>
      <p>
        We created an android app to pair you up with strangers to have lunches with. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saIIK2d_2TU">A silly promotional video is on YouTube</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I worked on the interface design. You can check out the design process in our <a href="projects/lunch.roulette.pdf">slide deck (PDF)</a>. This occured at the inaugral <a href="http://http://hacktech.io">Hacktech</a> in 2014.
      </p>


      <h3>SurroundSound</h3>
      <p>
        My teammates and I tried to create a solution for delivering music most people at a social event would like. We attempt to provide a curated YouTube playlist for a DJ based on attendee's music preferences. I think it worked once.

        The code is <a href="https://github.com/mHacks-UWProject/SurroundSound">open-sourced on GitHub</a>. This occured at the inaugral <a href="http://mhacks.org">MHacks</a> in 2012.
